## 📘 Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict company profit based on financial expenditures such as:
- R&D Spend  
- Administration Cost  
- Marketing Spend  
- State (categorical feature)

The project follows a complete ML pipeline including preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation, and business insights.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze how different expenditures affect company profit.
- Identify which features contribute most to profitability.
- Train and compare multiple regression models.
- Evaluate model performance using R², RMSE, MAE, and cross-validation.
- Recommend the best model for real-world prediction.
